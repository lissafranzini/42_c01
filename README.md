<h2 align="center"> Description </h2>
This project contains my answer to all the exercises form list c01 - 42 piscine.
I plan to upload other lists in my github, but I need to find time to organize the files.

<h3 align="left"> What is piscine </h3>
"Piscine" is an intensive 26 days training program provided by 42.
During the piscine, participants learn about shell commands and the basics of sofware development using C language.

<h3 align="left"> What is list c01 </h3>
During the program, participants have different list of exercises to solve.
List c01 is a list that contains exercises where the concept of pointers is needed.
The list itself is copyrighted, so I can't upload it here.

<h3 align="left"> Are the answers correct? </h3>
I'm proud to say that I got 100% score in this list, so the exercises are correct.
But be aware that 42 might change the content of their lists over time, so your c01 might not correspond exactly to mine!
